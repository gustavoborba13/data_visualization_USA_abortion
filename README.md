# data_visualization_USA_abortion

This project was part of the Data Visualization course at Lund University School of Economics and Management. 

## Overview 
The idea of this project was to explore different forms of visualization to understand the chosen dataset. 

The project contains:
* a density plot relating abortion restrictions and abortion rate.
* a scatter plot to check if the abortion rates and restriction levels could be correlated to the politics of each state by adding the democracy variable into our plot
* a faceted plot by three political options (Majority Republican, Even, Majority Democrat) with colors describing if state laws prohibit same-sex relationships.
* a choropleth mapping the abortion rates throughout the United States territory

Note:. the .md knitted file contain few formatting mistakes that arose when converting .rmd to .md
